You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.



Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Input



Sample Output

20 20
20 21
22 23

SOLUTION


select a.X,a.Y from Functions a join Functions b where a.X=b.Y and b.x=a.Y group by a.X,a.Y HAVING COUNT(a.X)>1 or a.X<a.Y order by a.X;
