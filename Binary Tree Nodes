You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.



Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
Sample Input



Sample Output

1 Leaf
2 Inner
3 Leaf
5 Root
6 Leaf
8 Inner
9 Leaf

Explanation

The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample:


SOLUTION

SELECT N,
(CASE WHEN P is NULL THEN 'Root'
      WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT(P) FROM BST) THEN 'Inner'
      ELSE 'Leaf' END)as T 
FROM BST order by N;

OUTPUT

Your Output (stdout)
1 Leaf
2 Inner
3 Leaf
4 Inner
5 Leaf
6 Inner
7 Leaf
8 Leaf
9 Inner
10 Leaf
11 Inner
12 Leaf
13 Inner
14 Leaf
15 Root
